Finally, everything about the graph is working !
Company selection, range selection, and it's displaying correctly !
Next step is to add some nice CSS to help it look good.
Also, the way the graph is morphing needs to be redone (check examples)

Added the chart in the app. But now I need to find a way to
refresh the graph when the data changes (right now the data
is stored in a standard var so it does not trigger a render)
And I can't store data in a state because I can't setState in
a render... So I must find a way to call the Graph component.

We now receive data successfully, however the text status
(which will become the graph in the future) is updated via
a jQuery call. We need to replace it with a react state.
Thing is the api call is in the render and I can't update
a state in a render.
Two choices :
I move my api call out of the render and find a way to call
it from the Card handleClick. (or catch a change in a state
of the App)

Actually I can't think of anything else right now.

Also people recommend to use flux. >;()
